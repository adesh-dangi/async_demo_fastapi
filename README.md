# Async Demo FastAPI

This project demonstrates the use of FastAPI with asynchronous third-party API calls using the `asyncio` library.

## Project Overview

The `main.py` file contains a FastAPI application that showcases asynchronous HTTP requests to multiple external APIs. It utilizes `aiohttp` for making concurrent API calls, improving the overall performance of the application.


## Key Features

### main.py
Test /combined-data and /combined-data-normal which shows how normal and asynchronous call work

### feature_async_req.py

The `feature_async_req.py` file is a crucial component of this project, demonstrating the power of asynchronous programming in Python. Here's an overview of its main features:

1. **Asynchronous HTTP Requests**: This file showcases how to make multiple asynchronous HTTP requests using the `aiohttp` library. This approach allows for concurrent API calls, significantly reducing the total time required when fetching data from multiple sources.

2. **Custom Async Functions**: It defines custom asynchronous functions (coroutines) that encapsulate the logic for making API requests and processing the responses. These functions use the `async` and `await` keywords, which are fundamental to Python's asynchronous programming model.

3. **Error Handling**: The file implements robust error handling mechanisms to deal with potential issues during HTTP requests, such as network errors or invalid responses. This ensures the application remains stable even when external services are unreliable.

4. **Response Processing**: It demonstrates how to process JSON responses from APIs asynchronously, extracting relevant data and preparing it for further use in the application.

5. **Concurrent Execution**: The file utilizes `asyncio.gather()` to run multiple API requests concurrently, maximizing efficiency and minimizing overall response time.

6. **Integration with FastAPI**: While this file focuses on the async request logic, it's designed to be easily integrated with the FastAPI framework in the main application, allowing for efficient handling of incoming requests.

By examining `feature_async_req.py`, developers can gain insights into best practices for implementing asynchronous operations in Python, particularly in the context of web applications and API integrations.

### Asynchronous Programming: Pros and Cons

Asynchronous programming is a powerful paradigm, especially in web development. Here's an overview of its advantages and disadvantages:

#### Pros:

1. **Improved Performance**: Asynchronous code can handle multiple operations concurrently, leading to better resource utilization and faster execution times.

2. **Scalability**: Async applications can handle more concurrent connections with fewer system resources, making them highly scalable.

3. **Responsiveness**: Non-blocking operations ensure that long-running tasks don't freeze the entire application, maintaining responsiveness.

4. **Efficient I/O Operations**: Ideal for I/O-bound tasks, such as database queries or API calls, as it allows other operations to proceed while waiting for I/O completion.

5. **Better User Experience**: In web applications, async programming can lead to faster load times and smoother interactions.

#### Cons:

1. **Complexity**: Async code can be more difficult to write, read, and debug compared to synchronous code.

2. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand concepts like coroutines, event loops, and async/await syntax.

3. **Potential for Race Conditions**: Improper handling of shared resources in concurrent operations can lead to race conditions and hard-to-debug issues.

4. **Limited CPU-Bound Performance Gains**: For CPU-intensive tasks, the benefits of async programming may be less pronounced.

5. **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Not all libraries support async operations, which can limit options or require additional wrappers.

6. **Error Handling**: Exception handling in async code can be more challenging and require special attention.

Understanding these pros and cons is crucial for deciding when and how to implement asynchronous programming in your projects.
